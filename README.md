## Description

Self driving technology is well developed field and it is full of all giant minds trying to bring self driving car to roads of nation.

**Levels of autonomy:**

> Level 0 - Complete manual mode (no automation)
> Level 1 - hands on/shared control
> Level 2 - hands off 
> Level 3 - eyes off
> Level 4 - mind off 
> Level 5 - steering wheel optional

## Self driving car architecture

## Perception

Some of the most useful sensors for making any system autonomous.

* **Sensors**
   - Camera
   - Lidar
   - Radar
   - Sonar
   - IMU
   - GPS
   - Odometry

> **Sensor Selection Criteria**
>   * Range
>   * Resolution
>   * Robustness in different environments
>   * Perception of environment
>   * Speed
>   * Cost
>   * Size
>   * Computational requirements


## Planning


## Control


---------------
## TODO

### Level 0

- [ ] Parking sensors 
- [ ] Surround-view 
- [ ] Traffic sign recognition 
- [ ] Lane departure warning 
- [ ] Night vision
- [ ] Blind spot information system
- [ ] Rear-cross traffic alert
- [ ] Forward-collision warning

### Level 1 

- [ ] Adaptive cruise control 
- [ ] Emergency brake assist
- [ ] Automatic emergency brake assist
- [ ] Lane-keeping
- [ ] Lane centering

### Level 2  
- [ ] Highway assist
- [ ] Autonomous obstacle avoidance
- [ ] Autonomous parking.

ADAS that are considered From level 3 to 5, the amount of control the vehicle has increases

level 5 being where the vehicle is fully autonomous.
