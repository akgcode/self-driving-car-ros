## Description

Self driving technology is well developed field and it is full of all giant minds trying to bring self driving car to roads of nation.

**Levels of autonomy:**
1. Fully manual
2. ...
3. ...
4. ...
5. Fully autonomous

## Self driving car architecture

## Perception

Some of the most useful sensors for making any system autonomous.

* **Sensors**
   - Camera
   - Lidar
   - Radar
   - Sonar
   - IMU
   - GPS
   - Odometry

> **Sensor Selection Criteria**
>   * Range
>   * Resolution
>   * Robustness in different environments
>   * Perception of environment
>   * Speed
>   * Cost
>   * Size
>   * Computational requirements

### Autonomous car technologies in market

**ADAS Technology**

- [ ] lane lines detector
- [ ] Understand Road signs, traffic signs
- [ ] Locate pedestrians, cars
- [ ] Forward collision warning (FCW) 
- [ ] A collision avoidance system (CAS) 
- [ ] Adaptive cruise control (ACC)

Fully developed technology and large toolbox available; Need to choose right technology according to needs.
